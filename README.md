# Tableau_Sales_Analysis
### Present how the sales ($) have changed over time (by month/year) for the different regions. Make 
sure we can drill down from the region to the subregion and market. Highlight the interesting findings. 
Note that the sales are orderqty*unitprice. Highlight the highest and lowest point on the graph.
### Create a dashboard that shows overall revenues and total number of units sold. Add the three 
visualizations previously created in questions 1, 2, and 3. Make sure the dashboard in well integrated: 
have a filter for market and one for business segment that applies to all graphs in the dashboard.
